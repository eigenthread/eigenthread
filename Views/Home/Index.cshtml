            <p class="step-description">
                It may seem obvious to initialize a patent portfolio through innovation.
                It's a common understanding that a patent portfolio is built on innovation. 
                But have you considered how to leverage innovation to expand your patent portfolio 
                from its initial stage? This is the journey we will embark on here.
            </p>
            <p class="step-description">
                Albeit, conceive patentable technology through innovation.
                That being said, how does one bring about innovation within the context
                of creating patentable technologies? It is by finding good problems to solve. Here, 
                then, it is to say that creating seminal technology that would provide high value to 
                a patent portfolio is brought about seeking, not "good" technology to patent, but 
                seeking technical problems as a means to tease out innovation, where the technical 
                realization of such foreground innovation is materialized through technology, thus 
                bringing about seminal (i.e., precious) patent technology. Therefore, within a business 
                setting, where is the most appropriate venue to tease out innovation from "interesting" 
                problems? This venue should be R&D (i.e., the Research and Development department).
            </p>
            <p class="step-description">
                Ultimately, applied R&D will lead to the creation of seminal technology, which can be monetized 
                through patent authorship rather than licensing and litigation. However, implementing this seminal 
                technology may also lead to discovering additional problems that can be solved with patentable 
                technologies. In other words, the issues resolved while creating a workable 'prototype' 
                for the seminal technology may be patentable, and the value of these solutions is truly inspiring!

                Claim Construction Development
            </h3>
            <p class="step-description">
                However, two primary components of a given claim's structure provide the value of the patent 
                application as a whole; the first property is scope, and the second is validity. Now, 
                what are the differences between these two properties? The answer is that the value 
                from which claims are derived is from the scope of the given claims; if the value of 
                the patent is defined by the scope of the independent claims drafted under the given 
                patent application, then why bother with dependent claims? The answer is that dependent 
                claims are the patent application's "backup" if the United States Patent and Trade Office 
                (i.e., the USPTO) evaluates the scope of a given claim as too broad and invalid to be a 
                legitimate patent claim. Likewise, dependent claims protect the inventor from future 
                patent litigation within a court of law framework.
            </p>
            <p class="step-description">
                Wherein, to preface, dependent claims are nested within an independent claim. Moreover, if 
                the USPTO invalidates such an independent claim, this is not to say that the claim in 
                and of itself is invalidated. In as much, when
                independent claims are invalid by the USPTO; the USPTO will
                then "substitute" the invalid independent claim and look at the
                preceding dependent claims that are nested within that independent
                claim's structure, which was initially invalidated. Wherefore, the
                dependent claim nested least within the given "invalidated" independent
                claim's structure is substituted into the space created within the
                given the claim's structure relative to the initial independent claim found to be invalid. 
                Now, given the prior statement, how is the nesting of the
                dependent claims important to the "backing-up" of a claim's
                structure? To reiterate, invalidated independent claims will be
                substituted by its nested dependent claims.

                Patent Portfolio Cultivation
            </h3>
            <p class="step-description">
                The principles of developing a healthy patent portfolio requires deliberation 
                even before the first patent application is sent to the United States Patent 
                and Trade Office (i.e. the USPTO). Here then, it is to say that the 
                development of a healthy patent portfolio requires strategic thinking.
                
            </p>
            <p class="step-description">
                As a means to detail the issue of strategic thinking in conjunction with
                that of patent portfolio development, this strategic approach is the
                intermingling of patent and corporate (e.g., company) strategy.
                Specifically, patent strategy development is different from corporate strategy; 
                a given patent strategy supports a company's strategic goals and aims directly.
            </p>
            <p class="step-description">
                With this, nurturing a corporate strategy is beyond the scope of
                this newsletter. That being said, broadly, the universal principle
                corporate strategy is to occupy a strategic niche within the marketplace, 
                where the given business conducts operations; the given company is motivated to 
                gain from and defend such a market position. With this, the statement above is the ethos 
                as to why patent portfolio development is paramount to overall success in achieving a 
                given corporate strategy; to describe patent portfolio development and its underlying strategy
                (instead of the corporate strategy), it is primarily conducted within the
                company's Research and Development (i.e., R&D department). Here,
                one can see the organic intermingling of the patent strategy and
                the corporate strategy simply from where the production of patent
                technology is taking place; the R&D department is central to the
                given the company's relevance to the consumers' product preferences
                and market-desires.
            </p>
            <p class="step-description">
                Thus, the value of developing a healthy patent portfolio is that it
                leads to competitive advantage. Thus, monopolizing market share;
                finally paving the way for that company to realize their corporate
                goals and aims, underlying their corporate strategy by driving out
                competition instead of patent thicket deployment.
