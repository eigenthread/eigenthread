{"abstractText": ["This invention describes a new method to generate hybrid seed in any crop plant while also reducing contamination from out-crossings and self-pollination. In contrast to conventional seed production methods, the method of the invention is not dependent on the use of any form of male sterility in the female parent plants, nor the use of isolation distances from unrelated and undesirable plants of the same species, nor the use of male parent plants in proximity to the targeted females. The process involves the delivery of pollen of the male parent at will, as available either in a preserved pollen bank, or using real-time collection from male plants as they become available. Desired pollen is delivered to fertile females during the period when viable pollen from the females and locally proximal unrelated plants is not being released. The delivered male pollen is in such amounts and fortuitously timed that it preferentially pollinates the females and produces relatively pure hybrid seed at levels much higher than if one used current hybrid production practices and did not utilize male sterility practices or prescribed isolation distances. Such fortuitous timing may involve the intentional application of pollen to females a day or two prior to female parent pollen becoming viable, and/or several consecutive mornings prior to female parent pollen or other proximal plant pollen beginning to shed each day."]},
{"abstractText": ["This invention describes a new method to increase grain yields in any crop plant by modifying pollination to effect an increase in grain yield, a change in grain content or characteristics, a decrease in contamination, or a combination of these attributes. The process involves the intentional delivery of pollen of the male plant at will, as available either in a preserved pollen bank, or real-time collection from male plants as they become available, in a growth chamber for example. Desired pollen is delivered to fertile females. The delivered pollenis in such amounts and fortuitously timed that it preferentially pollinates the females and optionally, avoids or enhances self-pollination or pollination from neighboring plants. The intentional delivery of genetically different pollen will result in increased heterosis and accompanying grain yield increases resulting from increased grain size and the potential to influence grain content and constituents. The invention also permits real-time agronomic decision making in order to maximize grain yield by overcoming biotic and abiotic challenges in the growing season which may or may not have been anticipated. The intentional delivery of self- or sib-pollen results in a decrease in contamination from undesirable outcrossing."]},
